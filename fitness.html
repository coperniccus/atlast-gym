            <b> 6 TYPES OF FITNESS TRAINING FOR A WELL-ROUNDED GYM ROUTINE</b> <br><br>
While there are countless types of fitness training available, we’ve included six categories below that, combined, offer a well-rounded fitness training routine for most individuals. <br><br>

Of course, before beginning any new physical activity, consult your physician if you have any concerns. <br><br>

<b>1. FUNCTIONAL TRAINING</b><br>
Functional training is a type of exercise that aims to improve daily function outside the gym. Because of this, functional training involves exercises that mimic real-life movements and can be categorized into four types: pushing, pulling, squatting, and rotating. <br><br>

This type of fitness training can benefit individuals of all fitness levels and is particularly appealing to those who want to improve their overall strength, balance, and coordination. It's best for those looking for better daily performance rather than someone looking to achieve a specific look or hit a certain number on the scale. <br><br>

<b>2. MOBILITY TRAINING</b><br>
Mobility training focuses on improving flexibility, joint range of motion, and overall movement quality. It involves exercises that target specific areas of the body and can benefit people of all fitness levels, especially those who want to improve their posture, reduce pain, and prevent injury. <br><br> 

Types of mobility training may include using a foam roller after working out or on a rest day or including a few leg swings before or after a cardio workout. Explore more mobility training options here. <br><br>

<b>3. STRENGTH TRAINING</b><br>
Strength training encompasses many activities, including weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing exercises, calisthenics, and weight lifting.  Strength training focuses primarily on building and strengthening muscles. This type of training can benefit individuals of all fitness levels and ages, from beginners to experienced athletes. <br><br>

Strength training can be a great complementary routine. Check out how strength training pairs well with an existing cardio routine here.<br><br>

<b>4. BALANCE TRAINING</b><br>
Balance training involves exercises that improve your ability to control and stabilize your body. It includes standing on one leg, lunges, and yoga poses.<br><br> 

This type of training can benefit athletes looking to improve their performance, older adults looking to prevent falls, and anyone wanting to improve their overall stability and coordination. Plus, it’s easy to work into a fitness routine, whether at the gym, or balancing on one leg during commercials the next time you watch TV. <br> <br>

<b>5. STRETCHING</b><br>
Stretching is a more passive way to bolster your fitness training routine. You can increase flexibility regularly through a few easy stretches each day and before or after other types of exercise. Stretching is beneficial for overall health to maintain mobility and keep other diseases at bay as you age. <br><br>

It is recommended to hold each stretch for at least 30 seconds and repeat it 3-5 times. Incorporating stretching into your daily routine can also help reduce stress and improve posture. <br> <br>

It's important to note that there are different types of stretching, including static, dynamic, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching. Each type has its own benefits and is suitable for different individuals and activities. It's recommended to consult with a fitness professional to determine the best type of stretching for your needs and goals. <br><br>

<b>6. AGILITY TRAINING</b><br>
Agility training is a type of fitness training that focuses on improving speed, balance, coordination, and reaction time. It involves movements such as ladder drills, cone drills, and plyometric exercises that challenge the body to move quickly and efficiently. <br><br>

This training style is ideal for athletes looking to improve their performance in sports requiring quick movements and direction changes. <br><br>
